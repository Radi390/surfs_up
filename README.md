# surfs_up

## Overview

This analysis examined data from weather stations in Hawaii that informed an investor who wanted to open a surfing/ice cream shop. The purpose of this analysis is to compare Temperatures during June and December.

In this project, SQLalchemy is used as a local database and Flask application to make it easier to present data.



## Results

- During June 1700, data points were gathered from different stations with a minimum temperature of 64 degrees. The maximum temperature sensed was 85 degrees, and the average temperature was 74.9 degrees.

## Summary

Overall, from this analysis, temperatures in Hawaii tend to show minimal seasonal variability between the Summer and Winter months compared to what is expected in other locations. However, as we can see in the following plot, in December minimum temperature is 8 degrees less than in June, and it has more days with less than 70 degrees.

In conclusion, while June is more likely for surfing, the December temperature will not prevent tourists from visiting Hawaii and wanting to surf.
